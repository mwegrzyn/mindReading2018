# mindReading2018

Website made from Jupyter notebooks using Python 2.7, pip, virtualenv, pelcian and the plugin from https://github.com/nikhilkalige/pelican-ipynb
The html pages generated by pelican are stored in an output folder. This folder must then be moved to a new branch of the project, named "gh-pages".  
The website will then be hosted on [](https://mwegrzyn.github.io/mindReading2018)
